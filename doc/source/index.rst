Welcome to Sarepy's documentation about removing ring artifacts in tomography.
This documentation is not only to explain functions used in the Sarepy package
but also to cover the following topics:

- Causes of ring artifacts.
- Classification of ring artifacts.
- How ring removal methods work; pros and cons of each method; how to use them
  efficiently; and how to improve them.
- Applications of the methods.

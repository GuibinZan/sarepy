*************************************

Sarepy is actually a part of the Algotom package which was released first to support
the paper in :ref:`Ref. [1] <references>`. Before `Algotom <https://github.com/algotom/algotom>`_
was released, methods in Sarepy were integrated into Algotom with improvements
to be more flexible and easy-to-maintain. There many utility methods allowing
users to customize their own ring removal methods. This section demonstrates
